<h2>About The Project</h2>
<p>Yelp is a popular website for finding reviews for businesses in the area. 
  This project posed an interesting challenge for how to implement a search function to 
find desired businesses. I did take some creative liberties by changing the theme from a database of any kind of business
to only businesses that offer afternoon high tea service. I hope you have fun with it!</p>
